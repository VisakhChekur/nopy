# Database and Page Properties

All database properties types are prefixed with "DB" while all page properties types are prefixed with "P". The reason is that the attributes available on a database property is different from that available in a page property.

Each property has a `type` associated with it which can be accessed via it's `type` attribute which returns a `PropTypes` enum. This `type` can NOT be edited.
